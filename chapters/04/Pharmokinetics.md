Pharmacokinetics 
=========================

Pharmacokinetics is the study of how drugs move through the body, including absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. It models how a drug is processed by the body from the moment it is administered to its elimination. Pharmacokinetics helps determine the optimal dosage, frequency, and route of administration for medications by using compartment models. Compartment models estimate the rate of change (kinetics) of the drug within organs.
