    "# Fick's Laws \n",
    "**Fick's Laws** describe the diffusion process, which is the movement of particles from areas of higher concentration to areas of lower concentration. Fick's laws provide a mathematical framework for understanding and modeling diffusion in various systems.\n",

    "```{admonition} Flick's $1^{\\text {st}}$ Law\n",
    "It relates the diffusion flux to the concentration gradient. It states that the flux \"J\" (the amount of substance that flows per unit area per unit time) is proportional to the negative gradient of concentration \"c\":\n",
