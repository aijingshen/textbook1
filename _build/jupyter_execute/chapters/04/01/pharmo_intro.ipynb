    "# Introduction to Pharmacokinetic modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmacokinetic modeling uses mathematical representations of how a drug moves through and is processed by the body. These models include drug administration, distribution, and elimination and are used to help predict drug behavior. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Absorption\n",
    "Drugs can enter the body via different routes. They can be taken orally, injected into muscle or blood, or delivered via a patch. The type of delivery will impact how the compound is absorbed and where it travels and is metabolized in the body. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Distribution\n",
    "After absorption, the drug spreads throughout the body's compartments. However, different drugs will spread **very differently**. For example, some drugs will spread throughput the entire body, while others will be concentrated in specific organs. This is often described using a simple concept called **volume of distribution (Vd)**, which relates the total amount of drug in the body to its concentration in the plasma or blood. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V_d = \\frac{\\text{Amount of drug in the body}}{\\text{Amount of drug in the plasma}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The higher the Vd, the more extensively the drug is distributed into tissues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metabolism \n",
    "Metabolism describes how the drug is chemically altered. Typically this involves transforming it into more water-soluble forms for excretion. Metabolic processes often follow **Michaelis-Menten kinetics**, but in many cases, they are simplified to follow **first-order kinetics**, where the rate of metabolism is proportional to the drug concentration. We will discuss reaction rates in later sections of the course. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Excretion\n",
    "This phase describes how the drug and its metabolites are removed from the body, typically through the kidneys (urine) or liver (bile). **Clearance (CL)** is the primary measure of excretion\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CL = k \\times V_d\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where k is the elimination rate constant, and $V_d$ is the volume of distribution."
