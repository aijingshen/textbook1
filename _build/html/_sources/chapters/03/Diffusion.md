Diffusion into artificial skin
=========================
The dermagraft is an artificial skin that has been used to successfully improve the recovery of wounds. Growing this artificial skin requires culturing cells on a scaffold make of structural polymers and extracellular matrix that promotes cell adhension and stimulates growth. 

In this section, we will explore the diffusion of oxygen into the scaffold. Ozygen is required by cells for aerobic respiration. Without oxygen, the cells can become anaerobic and may die. Therefore, the scaffold must be designed so that the diffusive flux of oxygen into the scaffold is sufficient to support cell health.
