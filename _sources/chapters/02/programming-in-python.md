Programming with Python in Jupytr Notebooks
=====================

Programming can dramatically improve our ability to collect and analyze information about the world. The purpose of writing a program is to instruct a computer to carry out the steps of an analysis. Computers cannot study the world on their own. People must describe precisely what steps the computer should take in order to collect and analyze data, and those steps are expressed through programs. There are many different languages that can be used to write a computer program. 

** Python** https://www.python.org/ is a powerful language that millions of people use around the world. It is vibrant, open-source, community-driven language that has many packages written for graphing, data smithing, and statistics. 

A **Jupytr Notebooks** is an interactive web application that contains code, markdown text, and code output. Notebooks allow you to create and share computational documents. Notebooks utilize the datascience package: https://www.data8.org/datascience/index.html
