    "## The MATH HEAVY Derivation of Mean Square Displacement (MSD) Using Random Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Walk in 1D\n",
    "\n",
    "At each time step, the particle moves either to the left or to the right. Let's assume:\n",
    "- The particle moves a distance $ \\Delta x $ at each step.\n",
    "- It can move to the right with probability $ p = 0.5 $, and to the left with probability $ 1 - p = 0.5 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the displacement $ \\Delta x_i $ after each step is a random variable, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Delta x_i =\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "+ \\Delta x \\quad \\text{with probability} \\quad 0.5 \\\\\n",
    "- \\Delta x \\quad \\text{with probability} \\quad 0.5\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The total displacement after $ N $ steps is the sum of all the individual displacements:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "x(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expected Displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the symmetry in the random walk (equal probability of moving left or right), the **expected displacement** after $ N $ steps is zero. This is based on the fact that the expected value $ \\langle \\Delta x_i \\rangle $ for each step is zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle \\Delta x_i \\rangle = 0.5 \\times (+\\Delta x) + 0.5 \\times (-\\Delta x) = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the **total expected displacement** after $ N $ steps is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle x(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i \\rangle = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes sense intuitively, because with equal probabilities of moving left or right, the particle is equally likely to end up on either side of the origin, so the average displacement is zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mean Square Displacement (MSD)\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the **mean square displacement** $ \\langle x^2(t) \\rangle $, we square the total displacement and take the average over many random walks:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle = \\langle \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i \\right)^2 \\rangle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expanding the Squared Displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to expand the square of the sum $ \\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i \\right)^2 \\). Using the algebraic identity for squaring a sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i \\right)^2 = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i^2 + 2 \\sum_{i < j} \\Delta x_i \\Delta x_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we have two types of terms:\n",
    "1. **Individual terms:** $ \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i^2 $ represents the sum of the squares of the individual displacements.\n",
    "2. **Cross terms:** $ 2 \\sum_{i < j} \\Delta x_i \\Delta x_j $ represents the sum of the products of the displacements at different steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Letâ€™s examine each of these terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Individual Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The first term is the sum of the squares of the individual steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each step $ \\Delta x_i $ can take values of $ +\\Delta x $ or $ -\\Delta x $, the square of each displacement $ \\Delta x_i^2 $ is simply $ \\Delta x^2 $, regardless of whether the step was in the positive or negative direction. Therefore, this sum becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\Delta x_i^2 = N \\Delta x^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This term represents the sum of the squared displacements over all steps, and it contributes positively to the MSD.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cross Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "The second term involves the cross-products of displacements at different steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\sum_{i < j} \\Delta x_i \\Delta x_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $ \\Delta x_i \\Delta x_j $ is the product of the displacements at steps $ i $ and $ j $ (where $ i \\neq j $).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's think about the expected value of these cross terms:\n",
    "- Since each step is independent of the others, and each displacement $ \\Delta x_i $ can be either $ +\\Delta x $ or $ -\\Delta x $ with equal probability, the product $ \\Delta x_i \\Delta x_j $ will be equally likely to be positive or negative. \n",
    "- When we take the average over many random walks, the positive and negative cross terms will cancel each other out. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the expected value of these cross terms is zero:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle \\Delta x_i \\Delta x_j \\rangle = 0 \\quad \\text{for} \\quad i \\neq j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2 \\sum_{i < j} \\langle \\Delta x_i \\Delta x_j \\rangle = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Final Expression for the MSD\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining the two terms, we find that the cross terms vanish, and we are left with only the sum of the squared displacements:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle = \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\langle \\Delta x_i^2 \\rangle = N \\Delta x^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **mean square displacement** after $ N $ steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Relating to Time and Diffusion Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "In a diffusive process, the number of steps $ N $ is proportional to the time $ t $. If each step takes a time $ \\Delta t $, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "N = \\frac{t}{\\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the diffusion coefficient $ D $ relates the step size $ \\Delta x $ and the time per step $ \\Delta t $ through the relation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D = \\frac{\\Delta x^2}{2 \\Delta t}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting these into the expression for $ \\langle x^2(t) \\rangle $, we get:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\langle x^2(t) \\rangle = N \\Delta x^2 = \\frac{t}{\\Delta t} \\Delta x^2 = 2Dt\n",
    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Thus, the **mean square displacement** (MSD) for a diffusing particle in 1D is:\n",
